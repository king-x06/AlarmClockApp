# AlarmClockApp
A simple JavaFX-based alarm clock app where users can set an alarm time in HH:MM:SS format. When the time is reached, a sound file is played. The app features an intuitive interface, alarm scheduling with Java's Timer, and sound playback using Clip. Built with Java 8 or higher.

Make sure to add the specific location of alarm ringtone so the sytem can use that for playing. Make sure it is in wav format.
